# Javascript-Code-Quiz-2


## What is this code?

This is code for a short timed quiz on javascript. It features dynamically created HTML and keeps track of your score. Time is reduced when the wrong answer is chosen and the user is given feedback. At the end, the user's score can be saved to a highscore page which has its data in local storage.
